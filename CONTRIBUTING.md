# Contributing to [Project]

Thanks so much for your interested in contributing to TRANSPOSE!

In order to make scholarly peer review more open, accessible, and fair, we need to collect more information about it. This project will help to bring transparency to the peer review process so that these values can be encouraged.

We will build a user-editable database of journal practices relating to the openness of peer review, the recognition of early career researchers who contribute to peer review, and detailed policies on preprinting.

These guidelines will help you get involved with TRANSPOSE.
