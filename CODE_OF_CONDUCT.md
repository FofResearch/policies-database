<!--- MOZILLA COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION GUIDLINES --->
# Participation Guidelines

This project, participating in the Mozilla Festival, respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The TRANSPOSE publishing policies project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you!

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

All our activities should be inclusive and supportive of diversity. Please let us know if you feel unwelcome or unsupported during #mozsprint (see below)

## Raising Issues at #mozsprint

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at #mozsprint which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact Jessica Polka, or any of the other Project Leads.

We reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.

Email: jessica.polka@asapbio.org. 

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of Mozilla's core values, #mozsprint program planning is done in the open on Github (check out their repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration during the Festival, and will continue to work with an open ethos after #mozsprint.
